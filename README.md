## How Does It Work?

![Enbridge Bill Sample](docs/enbridgeSample.png)

The extractor takes a bill as input, either as an image or as a PDF.
"Zones" are identified within the bill to identify where the key details are.
Using [tesseract.js](http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/) on those zones,
data is extracted and returned as a Javascript object.

ðŸ’¡ Note that while scanned copies of bills are oftentimes supported,
the best source is a bill downloaded directly from the utility company.
